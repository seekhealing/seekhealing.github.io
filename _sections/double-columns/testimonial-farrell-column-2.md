> I have attended rehab nine times. All the months I spent in rehab, everything I learned, does not compare with how valuable one weekend with Seekhealing was for me. It was truly an enlightening experience, and one I would highly recommend to others. Addiction caused me tremendous pain, and made me desperate for answers. SeekHealing has the simple, beautiful answer: human connection.

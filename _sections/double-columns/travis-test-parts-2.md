> Before SeekHealing, I lived my life in the shadows. I kept different parts of myself hidden from everyone in my life: I was a different person at work than I was with my family, than with my girlfriend, than with my drug dealer. Now, I live my life in the light. I'm living the life I want to live, and I'm being honest with the people around me about who I am, about what I do and don't want to do. It's because I have people to talk to about what's really going on, people who care about me and who will listen to me and not judge me for which chemicals I choose to use or not use.

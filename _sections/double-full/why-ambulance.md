Because <span class="emphasized-header">[lack of human connection reduces the interaction of endogenous opioids in the human brain](/science-of-connection/)</span>, the loneliness epidemic colliding with a saturated pharmaceutical opioid market was a perfect storm for addiction. <span class="emphasized-header">[Millions of people became dependent on and bonded to prescription painkillers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pdPrQFjo2o)</span>. The most recent study shows that <span class="emphasized-header">[44% of Americans](https://www.ncadd.org/blogs/in-the-news/44-of-americans-know-someone-who-has-been-addicted-to-prescription-painkillers)</span> personally know someone who has been addicted to some kind of opioid.

In response, the US government created increasingly strict regulations to limit prescriber protocols for opioid painkillers. Since the loneliness epidemic only continued to worsen during this time, demand for synthetic opioids to supplement endogenous opioid production did not decrease. So as prescription painkillers became more and more difficult to procure legally, it became more economical for millions of Americans who were bonded to opioids to purchase heroin on the prohibition market.

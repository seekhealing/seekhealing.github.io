### Physical distancing doesn't have to mean social distancing.

On June 12 to 14, we are hosting a free, online festival called “We Are The Medicine” to highlight the importance of connection during quarantine.

Everyone is welcome! This event is for the whole community, including those in recovery or anyone struggling with isolation. Invite loved ones, whether they're far away or in quarantine with you, and come connect online in a real way with other human beings.

Tickets are free. All donations & proceeds go to preventing drug overdoses through human connection and social health.

There will be workshops, games, and talks; including a keynote speech from Maureen McCarthy at the Center for Collaborative Awareness, Sara Ness of Authentic Revolution, Sarah Peyton of Empathy Brain, best-selling author Dr. Susan Campbell, TED talk speaker Dr. Rachel Wurzman, addiction specialists Dr. Anita Gadhia-Smith and Dr. Ron Smith, and Hilary Jacobs Hendel of The Change Triangle.

Experience new tools for creating deeper connection in your life, and learn about how creating more connection is changing the world into a healthier place for all of us to live. #WeAreTheMedicine

### Welcome to One Big Table hosted by SeekHealing!

If this is your first time here, please take a moment to register and consider making a donation to SeekHealing, a 501(c)3 non-profit working to reduce drug overdoses and deaths of despair by addressing the loneliness epidemic, clicking the 'Make A Donation' button once you reach the event landing page.

We invite you to watch the brief 'Intro & Orientation' video on the landing page when you first arrive, check out the schedule of events and plan your weekend by adding them to your Calendar app, and [peruse the auction](https://www.auctria.com/auction/OBT){:target="_blank"} items up for bid this weekend.

Our goal with this fundraising event is to raise at least $20,000 to supplement our program facilitation costs in Buncombe County, which you can learn more about by clicking 'Make A Donation' or visiting [seekhealing.org/giving](https://seekhealing.org/giving){:target="_blank"}.

If you have any questions, please reach out to us at <conversations@seekhealing.org>.

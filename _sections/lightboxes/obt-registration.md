### Welcome to One Big Table hosted by SeekHealing!

If this is your first time here, please take a moment to register and consider making a donation to SeekHealing, a 501(c)3 non-profit. You can make your donation through Eventbrite, when you register, or by clicking the DONATE button once you reach the event landing page.

We invite you to watch the brief 'Intro & Orientation' video on the landing page when you first arrive, check out the schedule of events and plan your weekend by adding them to your Calendar app, and [peruse the Auction](https://new-auction-url){: target="_blank"} items up for bid this weekend.

Our goal with this fundraising event is to raise at least $35,000 to fund our Extra Care program, which you can learn more about by clicking DONATE or visiting [SeekHealing.org/2020](https://seekhealing.org/2020){: target="_blank"}

A facilitated discovery conversation with Dr. Erika Czerwinski (practicing psychologist in Asheville, NC.) Here is a blurb from her Psychology Today profile; 'I specialize in couple therapy, life transitions, relationship struggles, professional consultation, supervision, parenting and ketamine assisted psychotherapy. I particularly love working with individuals who want to create change in their life, or who previously have not been able to find help, but are ready for change.'

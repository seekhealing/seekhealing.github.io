    bio: Joshua Ginsberg is a co-founder of SeekHealing and seasoned computer
      engineer as a systems and software architect, and works primarily with
      Python, Django, and Linux in the cloud. He helps software engineers write
      software that runs better on systems and ops teams design and configure
      systems that run software better. As a designer and configure platform
      technologies that create leverage within organziations, so other engineers
      can solve their own problems faster. I enjoy building, leading, and
      mentoring teams of motivated and professional software engineers. I give
      thoughtful talks on technology, teams, and culture. I contribute to open
      source software.

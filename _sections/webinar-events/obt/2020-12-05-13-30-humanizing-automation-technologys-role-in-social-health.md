The drive toward greater business process automation over the past three decades has
undoubtedly created vast quantities of wealth and improved business efficiency in
countless ways, replacing error-prone, manual human processes with scalable, automated
technological processes. But such automation supplanted every day human to human 
interactions with computer interfaces, to where a person can go about their day in this
world without actually having to have a single personal interaction.

In this presentation, Joshua will discuss how SeekHealing is integrating the benefits
of technological automation with the goals of social health, and he will present a 
vision for how technology and automation might better balance the benefits they offer
without coming at the expense of our sense of connectedness.

This lecture will discuss the the many different dynamics  and causes of disconnection, personal, social, collective and transpersonal and the vital “spiritual emergency” that this creates, expressed in the problem of addiction. We will also explore the role of birth, death and transcendence as pathways to re-connection and to the source of recovery and health for the individual, micro and macro social systems and global healing.

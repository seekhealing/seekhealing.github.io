In this offering you’ll learn the different forms of sovereignty and how they can support in creating the highest and most supportive connections and the distinction of co-dependency and self-sacrificial relating. You’ll be able to answer questions that will allow you to explore where you’ve been leaning in your ways of relating. You’ll be guided through a Breathwork journey to support in integrating new pathways for relating and transmuting patterns that no longer serve you and humanity.

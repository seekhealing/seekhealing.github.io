Shaunna Williams (a.k.a The Mystical Minister) touches on the importance of staying aligned to yourself when engaging in social experiences through healthy communication techniques. This includes setting boundaries in relationships, speaking your truth during emotionally charged moments without reverting to negative projections, and fostering inclusion during social engagements. Through these understandings we can remain true to self while staying present with others.

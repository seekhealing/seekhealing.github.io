    bio: "After a complete deconstruction of her world, Abby Wen Wu began a journey
      to unravel her humanness. She has discovered how the body is a portal to a
      deeper knowing, a storage palace of memories and emotions, and a microcosm
      of the larger world. To share this with the world, she facilitates
      experiential workshops for individuals, groups, and organizations to
      explore the mind-body connection and somatic embodiment. In addition, she
      helps build conscious businesses that promote growth and well-being. "

The body stores our histories, stories, emotions, and more. When we find a way to look inside, we can find a sense of belonging - to ourselves and to others. In this workshop, Abby will share some information and tools (e.g. Focusing, Somatic Sensing) to help you get more in touch with your body and yourself.

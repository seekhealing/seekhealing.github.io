      Thomas Cospito serves as the Harm Reduction Services Coordinator for WNCAP. Born and raised in New Jersey, he moved to western North Carolina looking for a change. After spending almost a decade in operations and production management Thomas decided to step away from the corporate world and focus on attempting to do some good. Under Thomas' stewardship, WNCAP's Harm Reduction program has grown exponentially to serve move than 1,000 people, stigma-free, person-centered services every month. As an advocate for community-based Harm Reduction, Thomas is working to expand syringe services across WNC through community outreach and collaboration. Thomas now makes his home in the beautiful town of Waynesville.

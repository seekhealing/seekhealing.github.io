    bio: >
      Cathy Courtenay has been on a path of personal and spiritual growth for
      most of her life. She brings her heart and deep listening skills to
      everything she does. Her range of experience with dance, somatic bodywork,
      Body Mind Centering, marketing, parenting, and leading the Art of Circling
      gives her a unique ability to cultivate authentic, meaningful
      relationships with her clients and meet them where they are.

      Her greatest strength is creating a safe space that allows others to be with things that feel difficult, and to stand fully in what’s real for them. Her warmth and love evoke the full expression, truth and authenticity of everyone she meets.

      All of her work teaches self sovereignty, authenticity and intimacy. She believes that these practices create space for greater compassion and love – and ultimately support us in uplifting humanity and living truly fulfilling lives.

Join this interactive session where Cathy will share 4 simple, yet powerful skills to rewire your relationships. Relational health begins with you. Having awareness about your experience in the moment is key- then listening, getting curious and being able to speak what’s true even when it feels difficult. We will touch on each of these enough for you to walk away with skills to practice in your relationships right away. The quality of our connections equals the quality of our lives - during this era of 2020 with all the distancing occurring, it is more important than ever to work on the quality of the connections that matter the most.

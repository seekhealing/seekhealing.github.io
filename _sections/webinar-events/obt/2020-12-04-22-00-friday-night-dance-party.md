    bio: Captain EZ - The Vibe Conductor is an environmental curator with a sonic
      arsenal that spans decades, styles and genres. I am a crate digger focused
      on showcasing tracks produced by local, regional and national phriends, as
      well as folks I haven't met, as of yet... I am a tone-setter that
      continues to master the science and practice of how to effectively and
      appropriately ignite any event, crowd or situation. If you make music I
      invite you to share links with me to listen too and hopefully integrate
      into the next experience. Thank you for connecting.

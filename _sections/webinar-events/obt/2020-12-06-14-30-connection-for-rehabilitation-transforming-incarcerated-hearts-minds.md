    bio: >
      Laurie has over 30 years helping people make real changes in their lives.
      Initially guiding people through major career moves as a professional
      recruiter, she now guides others in profound internal mind and heart
      shifts as a course facilitator. Laurie has the experience and heart
      intelligence to lead people wherever they’re wanting and willing to go.

      Struck by the power of Authentic Relating (AR) to enliven people and reconnect them with their true authentic expression, Laurie co-founded a nonprofit bringing two-day intensive AR workshops to prisons across Colorado. Why prisons? Because she’s committed to shining the light of dignity on the shadows shame, fear and degradation. Laurie’s vision is to bring about a world of healthy, connected humans - freed-up from the bondage of the past and turned on to the wonder of life, closing the gap between our human condition and our human potential.

Join Laurie Lazar as she touches on the need for human connection within the prison system and how the Realness Project provides this critical resource. With the shifts the Coronavirus pandemic has created, her team has pivoted to creating and distributing Authentic Relating workbooks to inmates which she will highlight and give an opportunity to practice in real time. These connection-oriented resources have been shown to reduce criminal and substance use recidivism rates. Partnering with SeekHealing, these workbooks will be provided to individuals incarcerated in the WNC area.

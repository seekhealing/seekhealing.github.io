    bio: 'Dimitri Mugianis is an activist, anarchist, community organizer,
      artist, and Bwiti N’ganga (spiritual healer). Raised in Detroit during
      the ‘60s and ‘70s, Dimitri was greatly influenced by that artistic and
      revolutionary epoch. Dimitri facilitates the “We Are the Medicine” circle
      at New York Harm Reduction Educators, incorporating ceremony and ritual
      with active drug users and homeless people. Born in Detroit of Greek
      heritage, Mugianis was once considered the face of underground ibogaine
      use. He facilitated over five hundred detoxes using ibogaine illegally,
      for which he was arrested and convicted by the Drug Enforcement Agency. He
      recently founded the Psychedelic (Dis)Integration Group in New York City.'

Join Dimitri Mugianis and Jennifer Nicolaisen as they discuss the psychedelic plant medicine ibogaine, which has incredible physical properties for counteracting opioid withdrawal symptoms and enhancing neuroplasticity for habit change. The medicine has been integrated by some treatment providers into a powerful protocol for ibogaine-assisted opioid detox and changed the lives of thousands. In this interview, we’ll discuss what ibogaine is and why it’s effective, and we’ll also explore the dangers of glorifying it as a potential “silver bullet” for America’s opioid crisis. The addiction treatment industry is rife with fundamental problems that perpetuate addiction cycles for those who engage in it; and ultimately can damage the effectiveness of the tools it commodifies, like ibogaine and even AA. This interview will provide some basic education about ibogaine, and also explore these nuances and red flags in the addiction treatment ecosystem at large.

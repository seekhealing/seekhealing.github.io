    bio: >
      Dimitri Mugianis is an activist, anarchist, community organizer, artist,
      and  Bwiti N’ganga (spiritual healer). Raised in Detroit during the ‘60s
      and ‘70s, Dimitri was greatly influenced by that artistic and
      revolutionary epoch. Dimitri facilitates the “We Are the Medicine” circle
      at New York Harm Reduction Educators, incorporating ceremony and ritual
      with active drug users and homeless people. Born in Detroit of Greek
      heritage, Mugianis was once considered the face of underground ibogaine
      use. He facilitated over five hundred detoxes using ibogaine illegally,
      for which he was arrested and convicted by the Drug Enforcement Agency. He
      recently founded the Psychedelic (Dis)Integration Group in New York City.

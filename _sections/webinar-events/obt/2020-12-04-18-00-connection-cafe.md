Our Connection Cafe is a space to meet and interact with others from the festival. One of our Space Owls (program volunteers who have completed our Listening Training series) will be facilitating and provide opportunities for people to engage with each other one-on-one or in a group dynamic. A safe container where no conversation topic is off limits, and never any judgement or shame from the experience you share in the Connection Cafe. A chance to be real and connect :)

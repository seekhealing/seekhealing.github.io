Our communication intimately shapes our lives. Yet most of us grew up without any formal teachings on communication, relationships, and our emotions. 

How can we best handle conflict and tension in our relationships? How can we create the richest and juiciest romantic connections? How can we synergize with others and have the highest level of productivity and innovation in our careers?

Authentic relating is a set of practical teachings that directly answer these questions. Join me for this dense and interactive session to unlock your own relational and social awareness.

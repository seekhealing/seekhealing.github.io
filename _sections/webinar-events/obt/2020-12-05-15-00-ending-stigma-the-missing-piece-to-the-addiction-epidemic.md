Confronting stigma and discrimination facing those with a substance use disorder is more important now than ever, and it represents the missing piece to our nation’s response to the addiction crisis. This brief discussion will cover key success factors in Shatterproof’s national stigma strategy and discuss a few initiatives already underway. It will also review the potential impact of reducing stigma, including saving tens of thousands of lives in the United States.

      Jennifer Nicolaisen is the executive director and co-founder of
      SeekHealing, an Asheville-based nonprofit using a novel protocol for
      treating addiction and fighting the opioid overdose crisis. SeekHealing
      offers a program based on the importance of communication and human social
      connection in addiction recovery. A 501(c) 3 nonprofit, Nicolaisen says
      SeekHealing is the first non-residential program to treat addiction at the
      community level. A graduate of UNC Chapel Hill, she studied linguistics
      and Chinese and also speaks French and Spanish. Nicolaisen is also a

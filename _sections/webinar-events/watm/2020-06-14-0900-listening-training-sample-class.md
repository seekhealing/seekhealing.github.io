Listening Training is SeekHealing's "core curriculum" for volunteers that reframes everything you think you know about addiction & socio-emotional wellness.  Whether you’re in early recovery, long-term recovery, or just looking to upgrade your communication skills, Listening Training is designed to support you in having more authentic and fulfilling relationships.

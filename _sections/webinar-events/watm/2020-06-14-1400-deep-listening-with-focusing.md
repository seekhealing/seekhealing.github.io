    bio: |
      After a complete deconstruction of her world, Abby Wen Wu began a journey to unravel her humanness. She has discovered how the body is a portal to a deeper knowing, a storage palace of memories and emotions, and a microcosm of the larger world. To share this with the world, she facilitates experiential workshops for individuals, groups, and organizations to explore the mind-body connection and somatic embodiment. In addition, she helps build conscious businesses that promote growth and well-being.

tagline: Focusing allows the person to go deeper into one's own awareness and allow for the emergence of innate body wisdom. It is an entry to the doorway to the mysterious, to a deeper intelligence, and to a field beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right doing.

Focusing is a relational embodied introspection, often taken place in dyads, where a partner facilitates the experience for us to befriend ourselves in a positive and supportive way. Focusing allows the person to go deeper into one's own awareness and allow for the emergence of innate body wisdom. It is an entry to the doorway to the mysterious, to a deeper intelligence, and to a field beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right doing.

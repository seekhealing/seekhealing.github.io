Join us for this open-hearted open mic, where guests will be free to share songs, poems, and stories from a place of presence and vulnerability in a safe, non-judgmental space.  Our audience will be listening with compassionate ears, and have a chance to also reflect on what they heard from the shares.

If you already know what you'd like to share at the open mic, email Asher at <radiantsong.asherleigh@gmail.com>.

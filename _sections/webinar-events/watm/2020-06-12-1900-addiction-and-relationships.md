    bio: |
      Dr. Anita Gadhia-Smith, author of five books, is a psychotherapist in Washington, D.C. specializing in addictions, recovery, and relationship issues. She is particularly effective, discerning and insightful about current issues that have a psychological impact on individuals and couples. She has served as a consultant to the United States Congress in parity legislation for substance abuse treatment. She has also spoken nationally and internationally on radio, television, and other media as an expert on a variety of topical subjects. One of the things that distinguishes Dr. Anita Gadhia-Smith is her own personal history of addiction as well as three decades of recovery. She has had a first-hand experience of a spiritual, physical and emotional “bottoming out” followed by a remarkable story of recovery and commitment to helping others who suffer with alcoholism, addictions and relationship issues. Her history and training allow her to approach her work, her perspective and her writing as a “healed healer.” Her story is one of redemption – she is a unique therapist who has become a successful, self-actualized woman by way of an intense struggle and personal journey in her own right. Her insights and wisdom are tremendous – and inspiring – about how to obtain and maintain ongoing balance in our lives. Dr. Gadhia-Smith has written five bestselling books: From Addiction to Recovery, Practical Therapy, Live and Love Each Day, How to Stay Together, and How to Heal Emotional Trauma. Anita  earned her undergraduate degree from The Johns Hopkins University (BA, 1985) and graduate degrees from The Catholic University of America (MSW, 1999) and Southern California University, (PSYD, 2001). In her private practice in Washington, DC, she works with adults and adolescents in individual, couple, and family modalities and says, "Therapy is a journey through which we find our authentic selves and become the best we can be. Through therapy, profound and lasting change can occur. My approach is to meet you where you are and to help you to move towards your goals, overcome obstacles and achieve maximum growth.”  Awarded “Best of Washington DC, Psychotherapy, 2013, 2018, and 2019” by the Washington DC Award Program. Honored as Professional of the Year in Psychotherapy by Strathmore’s Who’s Who Publication, 2013-2014.

    bio: |
      Dr. Ronald E. Smith attended the United States Naval Academy, graduating with the class of 1966. He attended the University of Texas Medical School and completed an Internal Medicine residency at the Mayo Graduate School of Medicine and Naval Hospital San Diego. Dr. Smith was the first physician trained in critical care medicine by the US Navy, completing his fellowship at the University of Southern California Center for the Critically Ill in Los Angeles in 1976. He soon became one of the first physicians involved in Navy Alcohol treatment. Ron left the Navy in 1978 and founded the emergency medicine residency program at Loma Linda University Medical School. His interest in addiction and recovery led to an interest in the psychological growth during the middle and mature years of life, which led him to complete his psychiatry training at Loma Linda, where he also taught emergency and critical care medicine. He returned to active duty in 1992 as a psychoanalyst and contributed as a medical consultant for the Ramstad-Wellstone Bill which was eventually passed in 2008 as the Parity Act. Dr. Ronald Smith is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Psychiatry, and Addiction Medicine. He completed his psychoanalytic training at the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute in Beverly Hills, CA and has a Doctorate in Philosophy of Psychoanalysis. Since 2002, he has been recognized annually by the Consumer’s Research Council as one of America’s Top Psychiatrists in Psychoanalysis and Alcoholism. Ron is married to Dr. Anita Gadhia-Smith, an accomplished author and practicing psychologist in Washington DC. (See Anita’s bio, above.) In retirement, Ron has continued his interest in political psychiatry. He works in private practice and continues to lobby for the treatment of our homeless and mentally ill in hospitals instead of jails and for the decriminalization of addiction.

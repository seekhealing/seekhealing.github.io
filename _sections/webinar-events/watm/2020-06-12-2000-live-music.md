    bio: |
      To Jen Worthen, being involved in music and performing as often as possible is equivalent to breathing. She started singing in fourth grade after being introduced to the musical Little Orphan Annie and has not stopped since! Though she did get some vocal training and education, as well as a degree in music therapy from Radford University. Jen wants to express her gratitude for being invited to be a part of this event and could not agree with SeekHealing more: we most certainly are the medicine!

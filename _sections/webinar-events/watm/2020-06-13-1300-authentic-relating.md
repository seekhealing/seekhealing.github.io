    bio: |
      Cathy Courtenay has been on a path of personal and spiritual growth for most of her life. She brings her heart and deep listening skills to everything she does. Her range of experience with dance, somatic bodywork, Body Mind Centering, marketing, parenting, and leading the Art of Circling gives her a unique ability to cultivate authentic, meaningful relationships with her clients and meet them where they are.
      Her greatest strength is creating a safe space that allows others to be with things that feel difficult, and to stand fully in what’s real for them. Her warmth and love evoke the full expression, truth and authenticity of everyone she meets.
      All of her work teaches self sovereignty, authenticity and intimacy. She believes that these practices create space for greater compassion and love – and ultimately support us in uplifting humanity and living truly fulfilling lives.

Built on a foundation of lived experience and the loss of a soul sister to addiction, Monica became an advocate for her local community in the fight against the overdose epidemic. After years of researching alternative options for those bonded to substances who also suffer from any number of social disparities she received the invitation to join the SeekHealing team as the Program Assistant. With the support of SeekHealing, she continues to explore substance use resources while spreading awareness and hope to her community.

Authentic Relating Games, put simply, are a place to practice being human. Our mission is to use games as tools to upgrade our communication and help us find more satisfying connections, healthier ways of relating with more ease and ability to express how we are actually feeling. Games can help teach us to be more present and true to ourselves while staying connected to others. The COnnect online Authentic Relating and Circling platform is an online community where folks gather 7 days of the week, 365 days a year to engage in facilitated connection focused games and circles, and to explore a number of high quality resources and content about the relational arts.

Mark Boughton has been studying communication skills and the psychology of relationships and interpersonal dynamics for over a decade. By the time he was twenty two, he had worked, traveled or volunteered on every continent of the globe, and had discovered a deep passion for understanding people. He stumbled upon Authentic Relating nine years ago, immediately fell in love with the practice, and has been facilitating relational practice ever since. He has a love for building community and bringing people together to connect, and also works as a coach helping people vision and actualize their deepest desires.

A space of fun, play, connection, and depth. After loosening with playful connective games and activities, we will drop in deeper together to create a uniquely essenced “energy beam” of healing to be directed to people and places that call our attention, and to ourselves.

This is an experiential gathering for those interested in connection & play, service to the expedited awakening of our planet, and shamanic heart-centered explorations.

A space of fun, play, connection, and depth. After loosening with playful connective games and activities, we will drop in deeper together to create a uniquely essenced “energy beam” of healing to be directed to people and places that call our attention, and to ourselves.
This is an experiential gathering for those interested in connection & play, service to the expedited awakening of our planet, and shamanic heart-centered explorations.

Sammy is a human, born of earth. Through synchronous means throughout his life he discovered that magic exists, that we can tap into it, that we are all made of it. His passion is bringing out the magic within all of us to create a world transformed for the highest and most vibrant good for all.

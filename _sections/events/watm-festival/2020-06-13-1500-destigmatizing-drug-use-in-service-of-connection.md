His biography includes leadership at the Free Software Foundation and lifelong advocacy for individual autonomy and against the carceral state, including the failed war on drugs. His 2018 TEDx talk “The Emotionally Eviscerated Man” boldly challenges social expectations for modern men.

> > Thomas Cospito serves as the Harm Reduction Services Coordinator for WNCAP. Born and raised in New Jersey, he moved to western North Carolina looking for a change. After spending almost a decade in operations and production management Thomas decided to step away from the corporate world and focus on attempting to do some good. Under Thomas' stewardship, WNCAP's Harm Reduction program has grown exponentially to serve move than 1,000 people, stigma-free, person-centered services every month. As an advocate for community-based Harm Reduction, Thomas is working to expand syringe services across WNC through community outreach and collaboration. Thomas now makes his home in the beautiful town of Waynesville.

> > Maegen Coral and Alexia Locklear are co-founders of Harmonia. Harmonia developed to address a major issue within the festival community that has gone unresolved for far too long: the need for a safe decompression space for individuals undergoing difficult emotional experiences. Harmonia provides harm reduction services via our Decompression Lounge to East Coast and Midwest events and music festivals.

Melt into a soundscape of gongs, crystal bowls, handpan, didgeridoo, monochord, and other powerful instruments.  These sounds help to relax, and open up to a greater perspective, inviting subtle shifts and healing to happen spontaneously.  Billy Zanski of Skinny Beats Sound Shop will be hosting this 60 minute special sound meditation.

> > Since 2004, Billy has operated Skinny Beats Sound Shop in downtown Asheville. Taking percussion into the realm of meditation and healing has become the cornerstone of his shop. After studying traditional music in West Africa and Brazil, Billy has developed an approach of combining natural low frequency tones with rhythmic progressions, creating space for inner work and relaxation.

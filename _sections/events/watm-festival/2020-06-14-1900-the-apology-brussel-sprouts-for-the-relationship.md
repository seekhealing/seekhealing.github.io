“Apologies are the brussels sprouts of relationships. They are good for us and they can mitigate the ill effects of a transgression.” ~ Sharon Belgley, author

In this session you will learn what keeps people from apologizing, how it can heal and strengthen relationships, as well as what to put in your apology and what to leave out.

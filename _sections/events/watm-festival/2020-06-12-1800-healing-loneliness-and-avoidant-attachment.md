The hallmark of having been raised by left hemisphere parents and/or in a left hemisphere culture is a deep, lifelong loneliness, a tendency to push others away and a struggle to find life’s meaning. This is a natural after effect of the contracts children who are left to “cry it out” make sense of it all themselves. Join Sarah for the latest discoveries concerning avoidant attachment and what they reveal about possible paths we can take toward healing.

Sarah Peyton is the author of the book Your Resonant Self, and is an international speaker and facilitator. She has an indescribable passion and a unique way of weaving together: a) neuroscience knowledge, and b) experiences of healing that unify people with their brains and bodies. Her presentations are funny, touching, and filled with personal stories and accessible science about our nervous systems. Her workshops change lives and invite self-acceptance and self-compassion. Sarah offers the healing experience of hearing ourselves and others deeply using the precision and resonant language that come alive in the long-term study of non-violent communication and body-centered explorations of families over generations through family constellation work. Sarah is a CNVC Certified Trainer of Nonviolent Communication and an experienced facilitator of Family Constellation work. She speaks and writes internationally on the confluence of NVC, Constellation work, and neuroscience. Sarah has held guest lectures at the International Systemic Constellations Association (ISCA) Intensive at Bernried, Germany ('14, '15, '16), has been a regular contributor to the Global Association of Interpersonal Neurobiology Studies (GAINS) journal and currently contributes to The Knowing Field journal. In 2015 she wrote a chapter on Constellations and Health in the German book, Salutogenesis, edited by Stephan Hausner.

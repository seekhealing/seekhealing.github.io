Have you ever been alone in a crowd? Or wondered why it’s hard for you to find connection, when there are so many people in the world?

We try to solve for loneliness using an x amount of other people plus time. But, connection isn’t just about how much we see people, it’s about who we see and how we choose to connect with them — what we ask, and what we give.

In this talk and workshop, I’ll draw lessons from my own experience building communities and teaching connection skills around the world, while trying desperately to find my own not-aloneness from within severe social anxiety and depression.

I’ll talk about different types of connection, different games to play, finding what you want and what you can give, and navigating what often seems like a scary and insoluble realm of unmet need.

Even for those who thrive socially, this time may be interesting in helping you understand why you thrive, and how you can create spaces for others’ comfort as well.

I don’t have connection solved. But, I look forward to sharing my explorations so far, and exploring together into yours.

Sara Ness is an instigator of authenticity, ninja of connection, and awkward turtle of social situations. She has worked with thousands of leaders and groups across the world, from educators to executives, to explore our creative potential through better relating.

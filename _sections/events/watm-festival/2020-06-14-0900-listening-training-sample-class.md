Listening Training is SeekHealing's "core curriculum" for volunteers that reframes everything you think you know about addiction & socio-emotional wellness.  Whether you’re in early recovery, long-term recovery, or just looking to upgrade your communication skills, Listening Training is designed to support you in having more authentic and fulfilling relationships.

Ionsul is a coach, facilitator, and trainer in the art of building genuine connections and satisfying relationships. She has had her own private practice since 2015, and has facilitated SeekHealing’s core curriculum, Listening Training, since 2019. She is a mother of two and loves spontaneous dance parties in the kitchen. You can reach her at ionsul@seekhealing.org

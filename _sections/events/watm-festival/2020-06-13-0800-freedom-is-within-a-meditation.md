This meditation practice is for celebrating the jubilation within our human form as a vehicle and vessel of our transformation and transcendence. This event is about connecting us with body, mind, and spirit to achieve optimal and ultimate well-being. This will help set and hold loving intention for the container We Are The Medicine.

Gus is a Healer, Acupuncturist, and Tai-chi master. He is the founder of Euphorma Temple and dedicates his life to helping others use the human form as a vehicle of transformation.

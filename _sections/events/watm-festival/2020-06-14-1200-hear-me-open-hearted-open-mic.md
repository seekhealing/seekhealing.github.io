Join us for this open-hearted open mic, where guests will be free to share songs, poems, and stories from a place of presence and vulnerability in a safe, non-judgmental space.  Our audience will be listening with compassionate ears, and have a chance to also reflect on what they heard from the shares.

Asher Leigh is a singer-songwriter and self-expression coach living in Asheville, NC who performs original music, and offers programs that create safe spaces for body-honoring growth in the areas of creative empowerment and life purpose.

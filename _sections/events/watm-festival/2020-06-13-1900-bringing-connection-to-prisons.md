> > In direct response to requests from incarcerated participants in Authentic Relating workshops, Laurie Lazar co-founded Authentic Relating International (ARI) in 2018. Raised in a Jewish home in New York, she was taught to participate in Tikkun Olam - the healing of the world. And now, having led 18 two-day AR workshops inside of prisons and many Zoom follow-up calls, she feels honored to bear witness to real healing in the world.

> > Laurie met Dustin Gust when he participated in the first 'ART of Being Human' workshop she delivered behind bars at the Boulder County Jail in January of 2018. Their surprising and unforgettable first encounter left an indelible mark on both of their hearts. Today, Dustin is part of the ARI team and is on track to become the first previously incarcerated Course Leader for ARI.

> > Dustin is a former white supremacist. His biological family were mostly criminals and drug dealers. He didn’t know them, but his adoptive parents talked about them a lot and told him he was just like them. So he grew up with a lot of shame. He had his first run-ins with the law in elementary school. He was hungry for acceptance and approval. He became a “wolf”.
> > {:class="facilitator-bio"}
> > In and out of prison over 20 years, Dustin struggled not to recidivate. It was the day he found out he was going to be a father that he realized things needed to change. Having made a commitment to leave the "lifestyle", he was exposed to Buddhism and Authentic Relating, which gave him the tools to change how he showed up in the world. Since then his path has been one of reconciliation and a new outlook on life, and he is helping others like him do the same.

> > Today, Dustin is thriving. He is the proud loving father to his 4-year old son, on staff as a coach for new parolees coming out of jail through Boulder County, and he is fiercely committed to bringing The ART of Being Human to people behind bars.

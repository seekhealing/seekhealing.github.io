Sarah integrates Interpersonal Neurobiology (IPNB) and empathy into the Family Constellations experience. When we step into the field created by the constellation, we are stepping into the seeker’s right hemisphere, with its connection to the body, emotions, and its orientation in our relational world. This work opens the door to understanding how much information is coming in through our bodies. As this comprehension deepens, we realize that we can effectively partner with them for conscious movement in the world. We begin to move differently as facilitators and as clients. Constellations give us a way to harvest the body’s wisdom. Through constellation work we can unwind and unravel the frozen strands of trauma from our essential beings, so that we can flourish, live, and contribute our gifts with ease.

Sarah Peyton is the author of the book _Your Resonant Self_, and is an international speaker and facilitator. She has an indescribable passion and a unique way of weaving together: a) neuroscience knowledge, and b) experiences of healing that unify people with their brains and bodies. Her presentations are funny, touching, and filled with personal stories and accessible science about our nervous systems. Her workshops change lives and invite self-acceptance and self-compassion. Sarah offers the healing experience of hearing ourselves and others deeply using the precision and resonant language that come alive in the long-term study of non-violent communication and body-centered explorations of families over generations through family constellation work. Sarah is a CNVC Certified Trainer of Nonviolent Communication and an experienced facilitator of Family Constellation work. She speaks and writes internationally on the confluence of NVC, Constellation work, and neuroscience. Sarah has held guest lectures at the International Systemic Constellations Association (ISCA) Intensive at Bernried, Germany ('14, '15, '16), has been a regular contributor to the Global Association of Interpersonal Neurobiology Studies (GAINS) journal and currently contributes to The Knowing Field journal. In 2015 she wrote a chapter on Constellations and Health in the German book, _Salutogenesis_, edited by Stephan Hausner.

## Listening Training Registration Form

Listening Training is available on a regular basis in Asheville, NC as a 6-week course or weekend retreat. The community training costs $100. Free tickets are available for those who cannot afford to pay — please email <listeningtraining@seekhealing.org> to request.

The 6-week series is currently taking place online, instead of at SeekHealing’s office in the United Way building at 50 S. French Broad Ave in downtown Asheville, due to Covid-19.

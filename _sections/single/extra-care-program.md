If you’ve ever been bonded to opioids, amphetamines, and/or crack, AND you’ve either:

- used in the last six months or are currently using,
- experienced major life transition, or
- had a medical crisis

... you may qualify for free program services. The program provides ongoing aftercare and support whether you have never gone through treatment, are currently in treatment, or recently completed an addiction treatment program.

Whether your intention is:

- to stay 100% abstinent from all alcohol, drugs & chemicals
- to stay abstinent from one/some particular drug(s) and moderate with others
- to use medication assisted treatment (MAT) or other medicine to maintain a safer habit or step down to abstinence

... you are welcome in this program.

The only requirement is that you’re a **_Seeker_**.

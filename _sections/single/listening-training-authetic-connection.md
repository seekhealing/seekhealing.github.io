By completing this training, you'll become part of a radically different addiction treatment program in Buncombe County, NC. The disease of addiction shows up in individuals because it is first a disease of the community: a problem with how individuals within a group relate with one another. SeekHealing "treats" addiction disease at the community level.

The training takes place over the course of a 6-week series or 2-day weekend retreat, and covers techniques on how to listen supportively to someone healing from opioid addiction (which also involves listening to yourself and learning how to set compassionate boundaries).

After the training, youâ€™ll be paired with someone else in the SeekHealing community in order to practice the art of human connection on a weekly basis. The subsequent [program](/heal/) will accelerate both of your healing & growth and you'll also have access to all kinds of awesome, donation-based groups, meetings and activities to explore with other people in the community.

Listening Training is provided free of cost by SeekHealing, a 501(c)3 nonprofit. The program is entirely donation based. A donation is not required but greatly appreciated.

Prohibition markets often narrow to the most potent form of the prohibited chemical. The <span class="emphasized-header">[Iron Law of Prohibition](https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/alcohol-prohibition-was-failure)</span> states that "the more intense the law enforcement, the more potent the prohibited substance becomes. When drugs or alcoholic beverages are prohibited, they will become more potent, will have greater variability in potency, will be adulterated with unknown or dangerous substances, and will not be produced and consumed under normal market constraints."

So, much like liquor became more prevalent than beer during the 1920s alcohol prohibition, super-potent opioids like fentanyl and its analogs have become more common under modern opioid prohibition. They are often mixed with products sold as heroin on the street, and as the number of heroin users continues to grow in this perfect storm collision with the loneliness epidemic, overdose death rates have sky-rocketed in recent years.

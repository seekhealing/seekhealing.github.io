If you’re in our extra care program, attending SeekHealing’s [Listening Training](/listening-training/) is encouraged but not mandatory. The person we pair you with will be required to have completed Listening Training.

To help you manage your post-detox transition and empower you to live the life you want to live, we’ll work with you 1-on-1 every week to explore dozens of different connection-boosting activities in Buncombe County.

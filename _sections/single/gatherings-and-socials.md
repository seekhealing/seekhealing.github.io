Having (actual) fun is probably the most important part of all this. We host an almost constant stream of social events and gatherings, so that as part of working the program, folks in the community will be reaching out to invite you to come to games nights, potlucks, holiday parties, concerts, cooking parties, wig parties... it gets weirder, but we’ll let you find that out for yourself. The point is, you’ll be surrounded by opportunities to come hang out and connect in a trigger-free environment with other people who are there because they want to connect, too. Sometimes you need a break from recovery and talking about drug use so that you can actually recover.

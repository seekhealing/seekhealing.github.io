# How It Works

![Weekly Meetings](/assets/images/weekly-meetings.png){:class="img-responsive"}

As a seeker in the SeekHealing program, we’ll get you paired up to meet with someone once a week in order to practice a more meaningful type of social connection. If you’re working the steps, your SeekHealing person will be a nice complement to having a sponsor: unlike a sponsor, your person will not give you any specific advice or instructions for your recovery. They will be just another seeker like you. They may have substance use history, or they may not, but either way they have made a commitment to being more intentional about getting their connection needs met (just like you have by joining this program).

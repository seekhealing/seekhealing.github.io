# **COVID-19 Updates**

Connection Practice meetings and Listening Training classes are both now available online. Please check out the calendar [here](/calendar/), or sign up for Listening Training online [here](/listening-training/).

Connection Practice meetings are also happening in-person locally in Asheville, NC at SeekHealing’s offices in the United Way Building. Please note that face-coverings are required at all in-person meetings.

Remember, physical distancing doesn’t have to mean social distancing. Connection during this time is more important than ever.

## **Herbal First Aid Kits**

Volunteers are assembling baskets filled with herbal comforts and remedies to support people in the community who are in involuntary opioid withdrawal due to the quarantine, or who are without housing or under-housed and suffering in fear and anxiety. \\

![Listening Line](/assets/images/covid-listening-line.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Volunteers who’ve completed Listening Training are getting on the phones to rally the community, to proactively reach out to those who self-isolate, and to hold space with those who have phone access but no internet access -- or with any human being who’s in need of a friendly voice at the other end of the line.

[Sign up for Listening Training today](/listening-training/) to volunteer, or call or text 828-547-0222 any time to connect with another human.

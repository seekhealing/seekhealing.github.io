Connection Practice meetings and Listening Training classes are both now available online. Please check out the calendar [here](/calendar/), or sign up for Listening Training online [here](/listening-training/).

Connection Practice meetings are also happening in-person locally in Asheville, NC at SeekHealing’s offices in the United Way Building. Please note that face-coverings are required at all in-person meetings.

Remember, physical distancing doesn’t have to mean social distancing. Connection during this time is more important than ever.

# **December 2020 Update**

As the COVID-19 crisis continues to worsen every day, SeekHealing leadership has been carefully weighing the risks of continuing
in-person meetings during the holidays (which are already a higher risk time for folks suffering with mental health challenges
and addiction, under normal circumstances.

As of right now, we have decided to keep in-person meetings alive in favor of the mental & emotional health of those seekers who
need this support more than ever. However, we will be making some significant changes to increase safety precautions.

* In-person meetings will continue with the following new precautions:
* Require KN-95 or N95-masks worn appropriately (available for free at the start of every meeting)
* Enforcing proper physical distance between humans
* 24/7 use of three (3) medical-grade HEPA air filters in the meeting space
* Mandatory temperature checks at the start of every meeting
* Art meetings are either canceled or or converted it to a regular connection practice,
* Emotional Social is modified to exclude food service.

Volunteers who’ve completed Listening Training are getting on the phones to rally the community, to proactively reach out to those who self-isolate, and to hold space with those who have phone access but no internet access -- or with any human being who’s in need of a friendly voice at the other end of the line.

[Sign up for Listening Training today](/listening-training/) to volunteer, or call or text 828-547-0222 any time to connect with another human.

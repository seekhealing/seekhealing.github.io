Our program management staff will work with you 1-on-1 to help you explore things like hiking, yoga, foraging, meditation, martial arts, dance, aerial arts, gardening, horseback riding, painting, animal healing touch, Reiki, 12 step groups, alternative recovery groups, slack-lining, sports leagues, nutritional counseling, and more.

SeekHealing will cover any fees associated with getting signed up for these things, and our team will work with you on the scheduling (and remind you when you have an appointment coming up, and remind you again just in case). We’ll help you figure out how you’re going to get there (although we can’t provide actual transportation), and we’ll also have a conversation with you about what you do and don’t like, so you’re not obligated to continue doing any one thing. The point is to explore and find something you like and that helps you feel really connected.

A special version of Listening Training is also available with a clinical focus to licensed or certified professionals for the purpose of mastering attending skills and breaking down hierarchy in patient-provider dynamics.

It provides cutting edge education on effectively and compassionately navigating risk behaviors and refocusing clinical services through a harm reduction lens. The course is designed mindfully as a self-care resource for clinicians, and is certified by the [NCSAPPB](https://www.ncsappb.org/) for 15 CEU hours.

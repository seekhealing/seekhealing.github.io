Not in North Carolina? If you know a local community center or treatment facility who will sponsor Listening Training in your community, we can come to you!

Shoot us an email at <listeningtraining@seekhealing.org> and we’ll work together to figure out how to bring the revolution to your community.

I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) for more than 15 years, and nothing, including medication, has been as effective for making my life worth living again as my participation in this community.”

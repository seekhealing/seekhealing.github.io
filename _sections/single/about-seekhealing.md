## How do we build a community that is inherently <span class="emphasized-header">resilient</span> to addiction?

* No drug tests. No termination policies.
* Treat both the individual and the community for addiction
* Engage the whole community in treatment: people who use drugs, people who don’t use drugs, people who drink, people who don’t drink, people on MAT, people in Recovery, people who aren’t in recovery: anyone seeking connection is welcome.
* [Meetings](/calendar) that are about experiencing connection, not getting advice
* [Free training](/listening-training) in meaningful connection & conversation: how to heal social anxiety
* Authentic and substance-free [social gatherings](/calendar)
* Free meditation workshops, yoga classes, reiki sessions, art classes, and [more](/calendar)
* [Extra support for those at risk](/extra-care-program) for overdose in the form of free holistic healing services

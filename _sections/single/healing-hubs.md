# Healing Hubs

![Healing Hubs Co-housing Projects](/assets/images/hh-housing-farming.png)

We're currently fundraising to build residential facilities where people can come to experience [how SeekHealing works](/heal/) and heal from addiction through human connection. The SeekHealing project includes couple of passionate land-owners who have pledged two sites in North Carolina. The Healing Hubs we build on these sites will be co-housing projects that use farm land and unique living arrangements to create self-sustaining, intentional communities and a totally new concept for residential rehab.

By incorporating several different on-site business models, Hubs will create microfinancing opportunities that empower participants and provide healing-focused housing for diverse populations that have similar needs for authentic connection experiences, i.e., older adults, students, adults in mental health recovery, adults in major life transitions like divorce, adults who need co-parenting support, etc. The Hubs will have scholarship housing available for those in SeekHealing's [Extra Care Program](/extra-care-program/) who need residential transition support after detox or addiction treatment.

Our dream is to build self-sustaining farming communities that implement a non-medicalized protocol for detox, detox aftercare, and long-term community-oriented recovery.

These greenfield and retrofit building projects in semi-remote locations will offer seekers a physical place to change the pattern of their daily reality as well as the frequent, intentional experiences of authentic connection that will be part of living in community.

Hub facilities are neither halfway houses nor rehab programs. This is a hybrid concept that helps people transition from detox directly into a specific community and healthy lifestyle. The facilities are self-sustaining because their operating capital is generated through agriculture production, and because they intentionally engage disconnected groups of people who can benefit equally from shared living arrangements at the Hub. By providing affordable housing to demographics like retirees and grad students, Healing Hubs symbiotically benefit all community members through either a temporary or long-term experience of tribal living in a healthy community.
